Better Scientific Graphics with Matplotlib
==========================================

This workshop is intended to teach you how to put ideas into practice with
`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.  The goal is to demonstrate the underlying API
in a way that empowers you to build any visualization that you can envision in your minds-eye.


Topics Covered
--------------

* Discussion of scientific/data visualizations and its importance.
* Discussion of available libraries within Python (and others).
* Introduce the lower level API within Matplotlib.
* Recreate a simple statistical plot produced by Seaborn using pure Matplotlib calls.
* Build up a new graphic highlighting the components of its "anatomy".
* Select an idea from the attendees and interactively build it in real time.


Topics NOT Covered
------------------

* Dynamic/Interactive widgets (buttons, sliders, selectors, etc.)
* 3D graphics
* Animations


Prerequisites
-------------

This workshop assumes you've already attempted some form of plotting in Python.
