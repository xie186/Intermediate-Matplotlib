Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
-------------------------

`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ is the *original* plotting library for Python.
Its high level interface is intentionally consistent with `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html>`_.

`Seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org>`_ is built on top of Matplotlib and offers a 
richer aesthetic with a focus on statistical visualizations. `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_
similarly builds on Matplotlib with respect to geospatial data.


Bokeh
-----

`Bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ is an interactive visualization library that
targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction
of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very
large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive
plots, dashboards, and data applications.


Plotly
------

The `plotly <https://plot.ly/python/>`_ Python library (plotly.py) is an interactive, open-source
plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial,
geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.


D3.js, Vega, Vega-lite, Altair
------------------------------

`D3.js <https://d3js.org>`_ is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you
bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities
of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization
components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

`Vega <https://vega.github.io/vega/>`_ and `Vega-lite <https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/>`_ provide a
high-level interface for specifying D3.js charts. `Altair <https://altair-viz.github.io>`_ is a Python
interface to Vega.
